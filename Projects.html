    <h1>Project2</h1>
    <class class="m">

        <li><b>Name</b>:MoodMapoon</li>
        <li><b>README</b>: This a file related to Autism Detection Where A adversial Cartoon Movies are displayed and
            after
            analysis the sentiment judging the child has either Autism disorder or not</li>

        <p><b>Abstract</b>:Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by
            challenges in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Early detection and
            intervention are crucial for improving outcomes for children with ASD. This project aims to develop an
            AI-based system to detect potential signs of autism by analyzing a child's facial expressions,
            particularly their smiling behaviors, while they watch cartoon videos designed to elicit smiles and
            laughter.

            The system leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to track and analyze facial
            expressions captured through a webcam. Using a dataset of cartoon videos known for their humor and
            engagement, the AI model assesses the frequency, duration, and intensity of the child's smiles. By
            comparing these metrics to established behavioral patterns in neurotypical children and those diagnosed
            with ASD, the system can identify atypical responses that may indicate the presence of autism.

            This approach offers a non-invasive, enjoyable, and potentially scalable method for early autism
            detection. The project not only provides valuable insights into the nuanced behaviors associated with
            ASD but also highlights the potential of integrating AI technologies in pediatric healthcare for early
            diagnosis and intervention strategies.</p>

        <li><b>README</b>: Branching Out to Safeguard India's Tomato Crop: A Novel Decision
            Tree Approach for Late Blight Disease Prediction
        </li>

        <p><b>Abstract</b>:Agriculture is a cornerstone of India's economy, constituting 20.19% of its GDP. Tomatoes, as
            the
            country's leading agricultural export, face challenges due to climatic factors and diseases, with leaf
            disease significantly impacting crop yield and quality. This paper presents an innovative machine
            learning approach, leveraging the Decision Tree algorithm, to predict Late Blight Disease in tomato
            leaves. A comprehensive dataset encompassing various leaf attributes was collected and used for model
            training. The Decision Tree, chosen for its interpretability and capacity to capture intricate data
            relationships, underwent rigorous evaluation via cross-validation. This research advances precision
            agriculture by offering a dependable tool for early disease detection, enabling timely interventions and
            minimizing crop losses. The simplicity and effectiveness of the Decision Tree algorithm enhance its value
            in sustainable farming practices. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of our method,
            surpassing existing literature-based approaches. This work heralds a promising path towards
            safeguarding India's vital tomato crop and bolstering agricultural sustainability.</p>
